# A. Eckardt (aka *Spoon*)

*"What can be done by man can by done by algorithm."*

*Hello!* ðŸ‘‹ I am a full-time student at the University of South Florida.
I plan to graduate Fall 2025 with a B.S. in Computer Science, whereafter I plan to obtain my master's.

Currently, I am a Kotlin developer with a focus on desktop development.
In the future, I want to be able to create full-stack web apps with Kotlin as a backend.
A common theme in my projects is that they help to increase productivity and collaboration between people.

In my spare time, I enjoy strength training, reading technical writing, and going on bike rides.

Have a great day!
